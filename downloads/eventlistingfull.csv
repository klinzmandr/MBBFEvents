Observations of free-flying condors at Bittercreek NWR are very likely, but of course cannot be guaranteed. You will see a variety of other raptors flying and hunting in and around the grasslands and pinyon pine woodlands of the foothills surrounding the southern San Joaquin Valley; they include eagles, hawks, harriers, falcons and accipiters. The trip will focus on condor biology and the condor recovery program, including radio telemetry tracking demonstrations. Raptors and other wildlife along the way are encountered by traveling from the coast inland through the Cuyama Valley to the rugged mountainous terrain of ‘condor country’, possibly returning by way of the Carrizo Plain.
