He will briefly conclude with the global impacts of warming associated with a “business as usual” future and the needed reduction in fossil fuel emissions to avoid the more severe of these impacts.
John Lindsey, Marine Meteorologist for PG&E at Diablo Canyon, will then focus on a review of observed recent changes in the climate of the California Central Coast and what can be expected in terms of future local impacts.  These include warming local ocean temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, heat waves, more severe storms and sea level rise."
